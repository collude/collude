This directory hierarchy contains thrift binaries compiled for the various
platforms supported by the repo.

NOTE: The '0.5.0-finagle' version of the binary is a special one that can
generate thrift interfaces used by Finagle. Anyone who uses Finagle's thrift
support needs to point their build targets to use that binary, via the
thrift.binary.version build flag.
